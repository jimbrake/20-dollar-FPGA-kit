# 20-dollar-FPGA-kit  
### Parts list with pricing and web links  
Single kit price under $30, classroom kit (quant 30) about $20 each  

Wiring using male-female jumpers and one ground wire jumper  
FPGA board also available with small LCD screen  

#### The Gowinsemi tools may make this kit suitable for middle school students?  
Would expect a lessurely pace labortory classroom setting  
With the students learning digital/binary signals and logic  
Much of which can be done via PC simulator  
#### Instant gratification via preprogrammed configurations  
Use IO pins to provide connections from buttons to logic gates to LEDs  
Can also program an exampe operation of display board  

### Photos of complete kit: breadboard, DIP switch & either  
Cmod A7-15T board or  
Tang Nano 9K board (the losest cost board with sufficient capabilities)  
Board pins required soldering, Breadboard split and widened to allow  
better access to IO pins. Power rail shifted over to align with DIP switches.
