# 20-dollar-FPGA-kit  
### Parts list with pricing and part web links  
Single kit price under $30, classroom kit (quantity 30) about $20 each  

Wiring using male-female jumpers and one ground wire jumper  
FPGA board also available with small LCD screen  
As shown all screen and HDMI connectors available  

#### The Gowinsemi tools may make this kit suitable for middle school students?  
Would expect a lessurely pace labortory classroom setting  
With the students learning digital/binary signals and logic  
Much of which can be done via PC logic simulator (Digital Designer)  
#### Instant gratification via preprogrammed configurations  
Use IO pins to provide connections from buttons to logic gates to LEDs  
Can also preprogram an example operation of display board  

### Photos of complete kit: breadboard, DIP switch, display board &  
Tang Nano 9K board (the lowest cost board with sufficient capabilities)

Also Cmod A7-15T board pictured in the slides, or one can use any of the narrow FPGA boards.   
Nano Board pins required soldering, Breadboard split in two, widened allowing  
better access to IO pins. Power rail shifted to align with DIP switches.
