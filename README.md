# 20-dollar-FPGA-kit  
## Very similar approach with more choices

### Spreadsheet has parts list with pricing and web links
#### Tang nano 9K
Single kit price under $30, classroom kit (quantity 30) about $20 each  
Wiring using male-female jumpers and one ground wire jumper  
Nano Board pins required soldering, Breadboard split in two, widened allowing  
better access to IO pins. Power rail shifted to align with DIP switches.  
FPGA board also available with small LCD screen  
As shown all LCD screen and HDMI connectors are usable  
#### Alinx Spartan-6 AX309 (subject to stock on hand)  
Single kit price of $31.20, classroom kit with shared JTAG programmer at $20.77  
#### For the Tang nano 9K  
The Gowinsemi tools may make this kit suitable for middle school students?  
Would expect a lessurely pace labortory classroom setting  
With the students learning digital/binary signals and logic  
Much of which can be done via PC logic simulator (Digital Designer)  
#### For the Alinx Spartan-6  
Uses the dated and well tested Xilinx ISE tools  
No soldering or assembly  
#### Instant gratification via preprogrammed configurations  
Use IO pins to provide connections from buttons to logic gates to LEDs  
Can also preprogram an example operation of display board

Also Cmod A7-15T board pictured in the slides, or one can use any of the narrow FPGA boards.
